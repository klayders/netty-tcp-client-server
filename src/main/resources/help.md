RSocket
Initial release	26 October 2015; 4 years ago
Repository	github.com/rsocket
Written in	Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, .NET, Go, C++
Type	Reactive Streams networking
License	Apache License
Website	rsocket.io
RSocket is an application protocol initially developed by Netflix,[1] that supports Reactive Streams. The motivation behind its development was to replace hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), which is inefficient for many tasks such as microservices communication, with a protocol that has less overhead.[2]

RSocket is a binary protocol for use on byte stream transports such as TCP, WebSockets, and Aeron. It enables the following symmetric interaction models via async message passing over a single connection:

request/response (stream of 1)
request/stream (finite stream of many)
fire-and-forget (no response)
channel (bi-directional streams)
It supports session resumption, to allow resuming long-lived streams across different transport connections. This is particularly useful for mobile‹–›server communication when network connections drop, switch, and reconnect frequently.
